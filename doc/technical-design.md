Here we have some related problems that we have decided not to address, but which someone might conceivably expect to make.

Security solutions

Cost analysis

We don't think any money will be spent on this project. The programming will be done by us. The level and character design will also be done by us and some music/sound effects can easily be found on the internet for free.
