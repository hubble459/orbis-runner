# Functional Design  
Orbis Runner is a puzzle platformer. The game is set on recursive, concentric circles that alternate in color, on which a variety of enemies pose the player with numerous challenges.  
It is going to have a whopping 20 levels with 3 kinds of enemies and numerous obstacles. The controls are touch based, and will be kept simplistic to make it an easy to approach game.  
We haven't decided on the sound track but that will surely make it's way into the game.

1. Level: Shows the current level that you are playing
2. Game: Shows the player and the obstacles, and preferably backdrop with the last level
3. Controls: A space where controls can be placed, if touch controls are unreasonable

### Death Screen
Shows you that you died and gives you the option to either retry the level or exit to the home screen.

### Music & Sounds
If we have time we will 'make' the music/sounds ourselves, else we will just steal them from online.
